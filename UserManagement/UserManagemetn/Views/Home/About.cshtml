<p>Thanks for vising my site.</p>
<p>This site is still under construction</p>
<p>Since the data base deployment is still ongoing, the data is shown in singleton mode for temporary.</p>
<p>More management features have been implemented locally, like uploading and displaying images for books, and will be deployed in the future.</p>
